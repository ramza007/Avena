            Carbohydrates provide energy to your brain, red blood cells and muscles, and account for the majority of
            the calories
            consumed in a standard diet. The daily carbohydrate requirements for women can vary depending on age,
            physical activity
            levels, health status and weight. The type of carbohydrate you choose to include in your diet can make a
            difference in
            your health. Candies, desserts, white bread, white rice and refined breakfast cereals can quickly elevate
            your blood
            sugar levels, which can put you at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Knowing what kind and how much
            carbohydrate to
            eat can be confusing! On the nutrition label, the term "total carbohydrate" includes all three types of
            carbohydrates. i.e
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Starches (also known as complex carbohydrates)</li>
                <li>Sugars</li>
                <li>Fiber</li>
            </ul>
            Others are like naturally occurring sugar, added sugar1. A class of carbohydrates with a sweet taste,
            including
            glucose, fructose and sucrose. 2. A term used to refer to blood glucose.X, low-calorie sweeteners, sugar
            alcoholssweeteners that produce a smaller rise in blood glucose than other carbohydrates. Their calorie
            content is
            about 2 calories per gram. Includes erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, isomalt, lactitol,
            maltitol,
            mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Also known as polyols (PAH-lee-alls.)X, reduced-calorie sweeteners,
            processed grains,
            enriched grains, complex carbohydrate, sweets, refined grains and whole grains.
            <br><br>

            Starch
            Foods high in starch include:
            <ul>
                <li>Starchy vegetables like peas, corn, lima beans and potatoes</li>
                <li>Dried beans, lentils and peas</li>
                <li>Grains like oats, barley and rice.</li>
            </ul>

            The grain group can be broken down even further into whole grain or refined grain.
            A grain contains three parts, bran
            <ul>
                <li>germ</li>
                <li>endosperm</li>
            </ul>
            The bran is the outer hard shell of the grain. It is the part of the grain that provides the most fiberThe
            part of food
            that is hard to digest. Foods high in fiber take longer to digest and therefore affect your blood glucose
            more slowly
            (i.e. whole wheat bread, prunes and other vegetables)X and most of the B vitamins and minerals.
            The germ is the next layer and is packed with nutrients including essential fatty acids and vitamin E.
            The endosperm is the soft part in the center of the grain. It contains the starch
            If you eat a whole grain food, it contains the bran, germ, and endosperm so you get all of the nutrients
            that whole
            grains have to offer.
            Whole grain means that the entire grain kernel is in the food. If you eat a refined grain food, it contains
            only the
            endosperm or the starchy part so you miss out on a lot of vitamins and minerals. Because whole grains
            contain the
            entire grain, they are much more nutritious than refined grains.
            Sugar
            Can be:
            <ul>
                <li>naturally occurring sugars such as those in milk or fruit</li>
                <li>added sugars such as those added during processing such as fruit canned in heavy syrup or sugar
                    added to make a
                    cookie</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            On the nutrition facts label, the number of sugar grams includes both added and natural sugars.
            There are many different names for sugar. Examples of common names are table sugar, brown sugar, molasses,
            honey, beet
            sugar, cane sugar, confectioner's sugar, powdered sugar, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, agave
            nectar and sugar
            cane syrup.
            Table sugar is also known as sucrosea two-part sugar made of glucose and fructose. Known as table sugar or
            white sugar,
            it is found naturally in sugar cane and in beets.X. Fruit sugar is also known as fructose and the sugar in
            milk is
            called lactose. You can recognize other sugars on labels because their chemical names also end in "-ose."
            For example
            glucose (also called dextrose), fructose (also called levulose), lactose and maltose.
            <br><br>

            Fiber
            Fiber comes from plant foods so there is no fiber in animal products such as milk, eggs, meat, poultry, and
            fish. It is
            the part of plant foods that is edible, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes. When
            you consume
            dietary fiber, most of it passes through the intestines and is not digested.
            Make sure that at least half of the grains you eat are whole grains because you won’t get any fiber unless
            you eat the
            whole grain. The best sources of fiber are beans, while some of the top choices for soluble fiber include
            bran, oats,
            beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots, green peas, apples, oranges and pears. Fiber contributes to
            digestive
            health, helps to keep you regular, and helps to make you feel full and satisfied after eating. Additionally
            reduction
            in cholesterola type of fat produced by the liver and found in the blood; it is also found in some foods.
            Cholesterol
            is used by the body to make hormones and build cell walls.X levels — have been suggested by some so may be
            an
            additional benefit.


            Some sources of dietary fiber include:
            <ul>
                <li>Beans and legumes, fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (for example, apples,
                    corn and beans) and
                    those with edible seeds (for example, berries).</li>
                <li>Whole grains such as wheat pasta, whole grain cereals whole wheat, wheat bran, and oats. Whole
                    grain breads (at least
                    three grams of fiber, look for breads where the first ingredient is a whole grain)</li>
                <li>Nuts — try different kinds. Peanuts, walnuts and almonds are a good source of fiber and healthy
                    fatone of the three
                    main nutrients in food. Foods that provide fat are butter, margarine, salad dressing, oil, nuts,
                    meat, poultry, fish
                    and some dairy products. 2. Excess calories are stored as body fat, providing the body with a
                    reserve supply of energy
                    and other functions.X, but watch portion sizes, because they also contain a lot of calories in a
                    small amount.</li>

                <br><br>

                Women should consume 130 grams of total carbohydrates daily, which includes all the three types of
                carbs: sugar, starch
                and fiber. It is recommended that this constitutes 45 %to 65 % of your total daily calories .If you eat
                more
                carbohydrates than the recommended amount, your diet may not be balanced. Eating too many carbs may
                mean that you’re
                not getting enough protein and fat in your diet.high-fiber nutritious carbohydrates like fruits,
                steel-cut oats,
                quinoa, sweet potatoes, plain yogurt and vegetables provide carbohydrates that are less disruptive for
                your blood sugar
                levels, in addition to giving you fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.

                daily consumption of
                carbs. If your aim is weight loss, rreducing the amount and source of carbs you consume is one of the
                ways. It is also
                important to increase your fiber intake gradually, to prevent stomach irritation, and also increase
                your intake of
                water and other liquids, to prevent constipation.

            <h2>Nutrient Timing fact or myth?</h2>
            Nutrient timing is eating foods at strategic times in order to achieve certain outcomes. It is said to be
            very
            important for muscle growth, sports performance and fat loss. When you rush for a meal or protein shake
            after a
            workout, this is nutrient timing.

            <br><br>

            <b>Bottom Line</b>: Nutrient timing has been around for several decades. Many people believe it's vitally
            important, but not
            much research has been done.

            <br><br>

            <h4>The Anabolic Window</h4>
            The anabolic window -also known as the window of opportunity is the most commonly referenced part of
            nutrient timing it
            is based on the idea that the body is in the perfect condition for nutrient absorption within 15–60 minutes
            after
            exercise.

            <br><br>

            The theory is based on two key principles:
            <ul>
                <li>Carb replenishment: After a workout, an immediate supply of carbs helps maximize glycogen stores,
                    which can improve</li>
                performance and recovery.
                <li>Protein intake: Working out breaks down protein, so post-workout protein helps repair and initiate
                    growth by</li>
                stimulating muscle protein synthesis (MPS).
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h4>Carbohydrate Replenishment</h4>
            Carbs are stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen. Research has shown that glycogen is replenished
            faster within
            30–60 minutes after working out, which supports the anabolic window theory .However this may only be
            relevant if you
            are training several times a day, or have multiple athletic events within a day. For the average person who
            works out
            once a day, there is plenty of time to replenish glycogen at each meal
            Some research actually shows training with lower muscle glycogen to be beneficial, especially if your goal
            is fitness
            and fat loss. New research has even shown immediate replenishment may reduce the fitness benefits you
            receive from that
            session so although immediate glycogen synthesis makes sense in theory, it does not apply to the average
            person

            <br><br>


            <h4>Protein Intake</h4>
            Muscle protein synthesis (MPS), plays a key role in recovery and growth. However, while MPS and nutrient
            replenishment
            are important parts of the recovery process, research shows that you don't need to do this right away after
            a workout.
            Instead, you are advised to focus on your total daily protein intake, and make sure you eat high-quality
            protein at
            each meal. Basically, if you meet your total daily needs for protein, and other nutrients, the anabolic
            window is not
            important. The exception though is for elite athletes or people who train several times per day, who may
            need to
            maximize fuel replenishment between sessions.

            <br>

            <b>Bottom Line:</b> The anabolic window is a period of time after workouts that is said to be crucial for
            nutrient intake.
            However, studies show that most people don't need to replenish carb or protein stores right away.

            <br><br>
            <h4>Nutrient Timing before You Train</h4>
            The pre-workout window may actually be more important than the anabolic window. Depending on your goals,
            the correct
            timing for taking certain supplements may actually aid performance e.g. A well-balanced, easily digestible
            meal eaten
            60–150 minutes before a workout may improve performance, especially if you have not eaten for several hours
            In contrast, if your goal is fat loss, training with less food may help you burn fat, improve insulin
            sensitivity and
            provide other important long-term benefits
            Hydration is also closely linked to health and performance. Many people tend to be dehydrated before
            working out, so it
            may be important to drink around 300–450 ml of water and electrolytes before a workout
            Additionally, vitamins may affect workout performance, and may even reduce training benefits. So although
            vitamins are
            important nutrients, it may be best not to take them close to your workout

            <br><br>

            <b>Bottom Line:</b> Nutrient timing may play an important role in pre-workout nutrition, especially if you
            want to maximize
            performance, improve body composition or have specific health goals.

            <br><br>
            <h4>Nutrient Timing at Breakfast</h4>
            It doesn't really matter if you eat breakfast or not. Instead, what you eat for breakfast is what is
            important. Many
            professionals recommend a low-carb, high-fat breakfast, which is claimed to improve energy levels, mental
            function, fat
            burning and keep you full. However it can be argued that the higher fat burning is caused by the increased
            fat intake
            from the meal, not because you're burning more body fat.
            <br>
            While others recommend a protein-based breakfast to have more health benefits. However, this is likely due
            to the many
            benefits of protein, and timing probably does not play a role Nevertheless, if you do prefer a low-carb,
            high-fat
            breakfast, there's no harm in that. Your breakfast choice should simply reflect your daily dietary
            preferences and
            goals.
            <br><br>
            <b>Bottom Line:</b> There is no evidence to support one best approach for breakfast. Your breakfast should
            reflect your
            dietary preferences and goals.

            <br><br>
            <h4>Nutrient Timing at Night</h4>
            We all have heard that "Cut carbohydrates at night to lose weight". This reduction of carbs simply helps
            you reduce
            total daily calorie intake, creating a calorie deficit -- the key factor in weight loss. The timing is not
            important.
            Some quarters argue that carbs can help with sleep and relaxation this may hold some truth, as carbs
            release the
            neurotransmitter serotonin, which helps regulate your sleep cycle. Based on the health benefits of a good
            night's
            sleep, evening carb intake may actually be beneficial, especially if you have problems sleeping.
            <br><br>
            <b>Bottom Line:</b> Cutting carbs at night may be a good idea for losing weight, but on the other hand
            carbs have been known
            to help promote sleep.

                <h3>What is fiber ?</h3>
                    Fiber or roughage, is the part of plant-based foods (grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans) that the body can't break down. It passes through the body undigested, keeping your digestive system clean and healthy, which in turn makes bowel movements easy ,while flushing cholesterol and harmful carcinogens from the body. It can lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, improve the health of your skin, and help you lose weight. It may even help prevent colon cancer.
                    Fiber can be classified as insoluble or soluble. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. It is the bulky fiber that helps to prevent constipation, and is found in whole grains, wheat cereals, and vegetables such as carrots, celery, and tomatoes. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and helps control blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol. Good sources include barley, oatmeal, beans, nuts, and fruits such as apples, berries, citrus fruits, and pears.  Many foods contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. Generally, the more natural and unprocessed the food is, the higher it is in fiber. There is no fiber in meat, dairy, or sugar. Refined or “white” foods, such as white bread, white rice, and pastries, have had all or most of their fiber removed.
                    <br><br>

                <h3>The health benefits of fibre</h3>
                    People are not eating enough fiber. This perhaps could be due to its relation to bathroom habits. True fiber offers a healthy and effective way to stay regular, however that is not the only reason why we should be including more of it in our diets. Different studies highlight how eating a diet high in fiber can boost your immune system and overall health,  and improve how you look and feel. Some of the benefits include:

                    <br><br>
                <h4>Digestive health</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dietary fiber normalizes bowel movements by bulking up stools and making them easier to pass. This can help relieve and prevent both constipation and diarrhea.</li>
                        <li>Reduces risk of inflammation of the intestine</li>
                        <li>hemorrhoids</li>
                        <li>gallstones</li>
                        <li>kidney stones</li>
                        <li>Provides relief for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</li>
                        <li>Helps in lowering gastric acid and reduces the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) and ulcers.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Heart Disease</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improves cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol.</li>
                        <li>A high fiber intake can also reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.</li>
                        <li>Fiber can also help to lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, improve levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, and shed excess weight around the abdomen.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Diabetes.</h4>
                    Insoluble fiber from cereals—can lower the risk for type 2 diabetes. If you already have diabetes, eating soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar and improve your blood sugar levels.
                <br><br>
                    
                    <h4>Cancer.</h4>
                    There is some research that suggests eating a high-fiber diet can help prevent colorectal cancer, although the evidence is not yet conclusive. Diets rich in high-fiber foods are also linked to a lower risk for other common digestive system cancers, including stomach, mouth, and pharynx.
                <br><br>


                    <h4>Skin health.</h4>
                    When yeast and fungus are excreted through the skin, they can trigger outbreaks or acne. Eating fiber, especially psyllium husk (a type of plant seed), can flush toxins out of your body, improving the health and appearance of your skin.
                
                <br><br>

                <h4>Weight loss</h4>
                    Apart from aiding digestion and preventing constipation, fiber adds bulk to your diet, a key factor in both losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight. Adding bulk helps you feel full faster. Since fiber stays in the stomach longer than other foods, the fullness feeling stays longer, helping you to eat less. High-fiber foods such as fruits and vegetables tend to be low in calories, so by adding fiber to your diet, it’s easier to cut calories. Other ways high fiber intake can aid weight loss:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By regulating your blood sugar levels, fiber can help maintain your body’s fat-burning capacity and avoid insulin spikes that leave you feeling drained and craving unhealthy foods.</li>
                        <li> Eating plenty of fiber can move fat through your digestive system at a faster rate so that less of it can be absorbed.</li>
                        <li> When you fill up on high-fiber foods such as fruit, you’ll also have more energy for exercising.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>An adult male need on average 20-38 grams of fiber while a female needs 21-26</li>
                        <li>The older you get the less you require</li>
                    </ol>

                    While hitting your daily target may seem overwhelming at first, by filling up on whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and whole grains you can get the fiber you need to start reaping the health benefits.

                    <br><br>
                <h4>Making the switch to a high-fiber diet</h4>
                    If you’re new to eating high-fiber foods, it’s best to start by gradually adding fiber to your diet and increasing your water intake. Fiber absorbs water so the more fiber you add to your diet, the more fluids you should drink. Suddenly adding a large amount of fiber to your diet can sometimes cause side effects such as abdominal cramps, intestinal gas, bloating, or diarrhea. These should go away once your digestive system becomes used to the increase in fiber, but adding fiber gradually and drinking plenty of fluids can help avoid discomfort.<br><br>
                    Refined or processed foods are lower in fiber content, so try to make whole grains an integral part of your diet. There
                    are many simple ways to add whole grains to your meals.

                <br><br>

                <b>Start your day with fiber.</b>
                Eat whole grain cereals to boost your fiber intake at breakfast. Try adding a few
                tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your favorite cereal. Berries are high in fiber, so try adding fresh
                blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or blackberries to your morning cereal or yoghurt
                <br><br>
                <b>Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole grain products.</b> Experiment with wild rice, barley,
                whole-wheat pasta, and bulgur. These alternatives are higher in fiber than their more mainstream counterparts—and you
                may find you love their tastes. Choose whole grain bread for toast and sandwiches.
                <br><br>

                <b>Bulk up your baking.</b> When baking at home, substitute whole-grain flour for half or all of the white flour, since
                whole-grain flour is heavier than white flour. In yeast breads, use a bit more yeast or let the dough rise longer. Try
                adding crushed bran cereal or unprocessed wheat bran to muffins, cakes, and cookies. Or add psyllium husk to
                gluten-free baked goods, such as breads, pizza dough, and pasta.

                <br><br>

                <b>Add flaxseed.</b>> Flaxseeds are small brown seeds that are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower your
                total blood cholesterol. You can grind the seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor and add to yogurt, applesauce,
                or breakfast cereals.

                <br><br>

                <b>Keep fruit and vegetables handy.</b> Wash and cut fruit and veggies and put them in your refrigerator for quick and healthy
                snacks. Choose recipes that feature these high-fiber ingredients, like veggie stir-fries or fruit salad. Add pre-cut
                fresh or frozen vegetables to soups and sauces. For example, mix chopped frozen broccoli into prepared spaghetti sauce
                or toss fresh baby carrots into stews.

                <br><br>


                <b>Replace dessert with fruit.</b> Eat a piece of fruit, such as a banana, apple, or pear, at the end of a meal instead of
                dessert. Top with cream or frozen yogurt for a delicious treat.

                <br><br>

                <b>Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice.</b> You’ll get more fiber and consume fewer calories. An 250ml. glass of
                orange juice, for example, contains almost no fiber and about 110 calories, while one medium fresh orange contains
                about 3g of fiber and only 60 calories.

                <br><br>

                <b>Eat the peel.</b> Peeling can reduce the amount of fiber in fruits and vegetables, so eat the peel of fruits such as apples
                and pears.

                <br><br>

                <b>Bulk up soups and salads.</b> Liven up a dull salad by adding nuts, seeds, kidney beans, peas, or black beans. Artichokes
                are also very high in fiber and can be added to salads or eaten as a snack. Add kidney beans, peas, or lentils to soups
                or black beans to a green salad. Beans, peas, lentils, and rice make tasty high-fiber additions to soups and stews.
                Don’t leave out the legumes. Make snacks count. Fresh and dried fruit, raw vegetables, and whole-grain crackers are all
                good ways to add fiber at snack time. A handful of nuts can also make a healthy, high-fiber snack.

                <h4>Fiber in fast food</h4>
                Fast food is often cheap and convenient, but finding a healthy meal with enough fiber can be a challenge. Many fast food meals are packed with calories, sodium, and unhealthy fat with little or no dietary fiber. Even a seemingly healthy salad from a fast food restaurant is often light on fiber—simple lettuce greens provide only about 0.5 grams of fiber per cup. Look for salads that include other vegetables, and whenever possible, up the fiber content by adding your own nuts, beans, or corn.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Other tips for getting more fiber from meals at fast food restaurants:</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Choose sandwiches, burgers, or subs that come on a whole wheat bun or whole grain bread.</li>
                <li>Try a veggie burger. Many taste much better than they used to and contain two or three times more fiber than a meat burger.</li>
                <li>Select a side of beans for a healthy fiber boost.</li>
                <li>Choose nuts or a salad over fries or potato chips.</li>
                <li>Combining a baked potato and a side of chili, available at some burger chains, can make a tasty, high-fiber meal.</li>
                <li>Several chains offer oatmeal bowls for breakfast, a higher fiber choice than most breakfast sandwiches. Try to choose lower sugar versions if possible.</li>
                <li>Finish a fast food meal with a fruit cup, fruit and yogurt parfait, apple slices, or a piece of fresh fruit.</li>
                </ul>

                It took me a bit to write this because I didn't want it to seem like you could eat only a very limited number of foods or that you have to be a 'hard-core' bodybuilder. But I did want to incorporate enough of the bodybuilding principles that definitely carry over to overall fitness. I also wanted to give you a couple of options for each meal to have foods to choose from. Some people, like myself, like to have a sample meal plan and just follow it with little changes. Others like to have a little more variety, keeping the same protein-carb-fat ratio but using different foods. You should like what you eat! I'm sure there are other equivalent substitutions, so when in doubt, just ask or go to the nutrition reference on my site, or other similar reference. I have used all of the sample plans, whether I'm competing or not. Stay consistent and you will see results.

                <br><br>

                <h5><b><u>What's the Point of Cycling Carbs (and Calories)?</b></u></h5>
                5-6 portion-controlled, frequent meals containing a balance of protein and carbs is a healthy nutritional plan. You will certainly feel good and attain that fit, energetic you. Having a free meal once per week on this type of plan could be considered a very simple way of 'zig-zagging'. Your body adjusts to what you eat just like it does training, so it's actually a good thing to plan a free meal not just for sanity reasons but to put a little spark in your body's metabolism. The Moderate Protein, Carbs, Fat with one Free Meal plan below represents this option.
                <br><br>
                When you are looking to shed some excess fat though, changing most of your carbs to fibrous types (vs. complex/starchy) while eating sufficient protein to preserve muscle, and then cycling in a high-carb day periodically, can stoke that fat-burning fire. It's something I like to do for an 8-12 week period, but then I'll go back to the 1st plan for a while (length depends on where I'm at). I may do the 'Moderate Protein, Carbs, Fat plan' for a few weeks and then do another 'cycle'. There are a couple ways to approach this Low Carb, High Protein Zig-Zag Cycle, and it's up to you: 2 times per week, either have high-carb meal at the end of the day or add additional complex carbs throughout the day. I'd like to stress that you shouldn't feel miserable or energy-free with this. But if it's a considerable change from your current habits, allow some time for your body to adjust. Keep in the healthy fats as listed--flaxseed, olive, or safflower oil --to provide some of the energy to compensate for the reduction in carbs. These types of Omega 3 or mono-unsaturated fats can actually help burn fat.
                <br><br>
                Oh yeah, stay active and keep exercising! Make sure to eat breakfast within an hour after you awake, and to get in a meal within an hour of working out. Try to plan your meal schedule with those two factors in mind and add your other meals around them. A general guideline to shoot for is spacing your meals 3 hours apart. I work out in the morning, so my post-workout meal is my breakfast. And that's just fine too. I still stick with mainly lower glycemic carbs after I workout.
                <br><br>
                OK, on to the sample meal plans! These are meant to give you ideas of types of foods and combinations to eat to get
                fit. These are portion sizes for a 5'5" female weighing approximately 130 lbs. Adjust your portion sizes appropriately
                based on height, weight, bodyfat%. For example, a 6' male weighing 200 lbs should be increasing the portion sizes at
                each meal to support more muscle and greater energy needs.

        <h1>20 Healthy Low-Carb Foods</h1><br>
            <p>
                Carbs have received a bad rap over the years, and while diets that completely eliminate them have remained popular for
                decades, cutting carbs entirely can actually do more harm to your body than good. However, if you’re looking to eat
                carbs but just cut back a little, whether it’s for weight loss or blood sugar reasons, here is a list of the 20 healthy
                low-carb foods to stock in your kitchen. Load up on these foods and watch your waistline while also making sure your
                body has the vitamins and nutrients it needs to thrive. <br><br>

                <b>20. Watermelon</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, diced: 11.5 grams (9.4 grams sugar, 0.6 grams fiber)
                Watermelon is a tasty and hydrating low-carb fruit. As with many other fruits, however, most of these carbs come from
                sugar, so indulge mindfully and in moderation. Use in smoothies or just slice and eat them  
                
                <br><br>

                <b>19. Broccoli</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, cooked and chopped: 11.2 grams (2.2 grams sugar, 5.1 grams fiber)
                Like many vegetables, broccoli is low in carbs but packed with other nutrients such as fiber and vitamin B6. Sauté it
                with heart-healthy olive oil as part of a tasty stir-fry or dip it in some hummus for a nutritious treat that you won’t
                feel guilty about.

                <br><br>

                <b>18. Strawberries</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, whole: 11.1 grams (7.0 grams sugar, 2.9 grams fiber)
                Fruit can be fairly rich in carbs thanks to the simple sugars glucose and fructose, but strawberries are on the lower
                end of the carb spectrum, clocking in at just over 11 grams of carbs per cup.

                <br><br>

                <b>17 .Green Beans</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup (cooked): 9.9 grams (4.5 grams sugar, 4 grams fiber)
                One cup of the cooked veggie has less than 10 grams of carbs. While the amount of sugar in green beans is slightly
                higher than the amount of fiber, they still make a low-carb and nutritious addition to any meal.
                
                <br><br>

                <b>16. Red Bell Peppers</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, chopped: 9.0 grams (6.3 grams sugar, 3.1 grams fiber)
                Despite a fair amount of sugar for a veggie, red bell peppers also contain about nine grams of carbs per one cup
                serving and have beta-carotene, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.

                <br><br>

                <b>15. Sunflower Seeds</b><br>
                Carbs per ¼ cup, kernels only: 7 grams (1 gram sugar, 3 grams fiber)
                Finding a low-carb snack can be tough, but it turns out that ¼ cup of sunflower seed kernels contains just seven grams
                of carbs. So go ahead and munch on a handful or so of these throughout the day or sprinkle some onto a salad for added
                crunch.

                <br><br>

                <b>14 .Spinach</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup (cooked): 6.8 grams (0.8 grams sugar, 4.3 grams fiber)
                Another low-carb veggie worth taking note of is Popeye’s favorite: spinach! Not only does one cup of the cooked leafy
                green contains less than seven grams of carbs, it also has a negligible amount of sugar and more than four grams of
                fiber. That sugar-to-fiber ratio alone means that spinach is a great food to load up on if you’re looking to get rid of
                that pesky belly fat.

                <br><br>

                <b>13. Air-Popped Popcorn</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup: 6.2 grams (0.1 grams sugar, 1.2 grams fiber)
                While we don’t recommend gorging on salty and buttery movie popcorn, one cup of the plain, air-popped stuff is actually
                surprisingly nutritious. Like spinach, air-popped popcorn has more fiber than sugar, making it an ideal snack for those
                looking to lose weight. Drizzle it with some olive oil and sprinkle some parmesan cheese and dried oregano for a tasty,
                filling snack.

                <br><br>

                <b>12. Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt</b>
                Carbs per 1 container (170 grams): 6 grams (5.5 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                Although yogurt contains the natural sugar lactose, opting for plain, nonfat Greek yogurt will up your protein intake
                while still staying low in carbs. Kefir—a yogurt-like fermented dairy drink—is a probiotic-rich treat that’s similarly
                packed with protein and light on carbs, which is great news for your waistline!

                <br><br>

                <b>11. Cherry Tomatoes</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup: 5.8 grams (3.9 grams sugar, 1.8 grams fiber)
                With less than six grams of carbs per cup, cherry tomatoes are perfect to add to a salad or eat as a snack for a
                flavorful option that’s low in calories. They are also a solid source of the antioxidant lycopene, which can help fight
                inflammation.

                <br><br>

                <b>10. Mushrooms</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, grilled: 5.3 grams (2.7 grams sugar, 2.7 grams fiber)
                Fungi are considered health food all-stars because they are a great source of potassium, which is vital for muscle
                health and recover, and can also lower blood pressure and decrease the effects of a high-sodium meal. In addition to
                being low-calorie and fat-free, studies have shown eating fungi can lead to increased immunity and protect against
                breast cancer. In particular, meaty portobello mushrooms contain the highest vegetable source of inflammation-fighting
                vitamin D and are frequently used as a meat substitute thanks to their hearty texture.

                <br><br>
                
                <b>9. Cauliflower</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, cooked: 5.1 grams (2.6 grams sugar, 2.9 grams fiber)
                Though white foods should generally be avoided, cauliflower is one of a handful of exceptions thanks to its
                nutrient-rich profile. The cruciferous veggie (which can also be made into a delicious “rice”) contains high amounts of
                vitamins C and B and about three grams of fiber in one cup.

                <br><br>


                <b>8 .Kidney Beans</b><br>
                Carbs per 100 g, cooked: 4.7 grams (0.3 grams sugar, 6.0 grams fiber)
                Not only are kidney beans an excellent source of fiber, but they’re low in carbs as well, making them an ideal pantry
                staple for those looking to shed a few pounds. Beans can help boost feelings of fullness and manage blood sugar levels.
                Try swapping meat for beans every now and then or even adding beans to a soup or casserole for an added dose of the
                nutritious legumes.

                <br><br>


                <b>7 .Walnuts</b><br>
                Carbs per ¼ cup, chopped: 4 grams (0.75 grams sugar, 2 grams fiber)
                The next time you feel guilty about tossing caloric walnuts on a salad, remember that one serving, about¼ cup chopped,
                only contains 4 grams of carbs. Other low-carb nuts include almonds, cashews, and Brazil nuts, which are all also
                excellent sources of fiber.

                <br><br>


                <b>6. Celery</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 cup, chopped: 3.0 grams (1.4 grams sugar, 1.6 grams fiber)
                Celery is famous for being virtually calorie-free, and it also happens to have very few carbs for a one cup serving.
                Though the stalks can get a bit boring when eaten on their own, consider pairing celery with tasty hummus or almond or
                peanut butter for added flavor and a boost of fat-blasting fiber and healthy fats.

                <br><br>


                <b>5. Parmesan Cheese</b>
                Carbs per 1 oz.: 0.9 grams (0.2 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                Believe it or not, hard cheeses such as Parmesan are low in carbs. What’s more? One ounce of Parmesan contains about 31
                percent of your daily recommended intake of bone-building calcium! Other low-carb cheesy options include blue cheese,
                cheddar cheese, goat, feta and Swiss, but make sure you consume them in moderation since they are also quite high in
                calories.

                <br><br>


                <b>4 .Hard-Boiled Egg</b><br>
                Carbs per 1 egg: 0.6 grams (0.6 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                One large hard-boiled egg (about 50 grams) contains less than one gram of carbs and remains an excellent source of
                protein. Eggs are also loaded with amino acids, antioxidants, and healthy fats. What’s more? Research has shown eating
                eggs for breakfast can make you feel fuller and help you eat fewer calories throughout the day, meaning that they’re
                quite the secret weapon for weight loss.

                <br><br>


                <b>3. Extra Virgin Olive Oil</b>
                Carbs per 1 Tbsp: 0 grams (0 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                With no carbs, sugar, or fiber you may not think much of extra virgin olive oil, but the cooking companion and pantry
                staple shouldn’t be ignored. Not only has EVOO been shown to boost levels of adiponectin, a hormone that breaks down
                fat, but it also contains heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. Other low-carb oils with similar health benefits include
                coconut oil, flaxseed oil, and walnut oil.

                <br><br>


                <b>2. Ground Chicken</b><br>
                Carbs per 3 oz., cooked: 0 grams (0 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                Not only is ground chicken a lean source of protein, but it’s also tasty, versatile, and carb-free. Throw some ground
                chicken into tacos or make a comforting bowl of delicious chili, and rest assured you aren’t consuming any empty carbs.
                You can also opt for ground turkey, which has 0 grams of carbs and is low in calories.

                <br><br>


                <b>1. Wild Salmon</b><br>
                Carbs per fillet: 0 grams (0 grams sugar, 0 grams fiber)
                If you’re a fan of fish, wild salmon is another protein-rich food that, like ground chicken, is carb-free. Unlike
                chicken, wild salmon is an excellent source of omega-3s, a healthy fat that fights off metabolism-slowing inflammation.

        <h1>20 High-Protein Foods to Eat</h1>
        <br>
            <p>
                Protein makes up the building blocks of organs, muscles, skin, hormones and pretty much everything that matters in your body. For this reason, you should eat high-quality protein at every meal. Studies show that this improves health in various ways, such as helping you lose weight and belly fat, while increasing your muscle mass and strength A diet high in protein also lowers blood pressure, fights diabetes and more .The recommended daily intake (RDI) for protein is 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men. However, many health and fitness experts believe that we need much more than that in order to function optimally. Here is a list of 20 delicious foods that are high in protein.

                <br><br>

                <b>1. Eggs</b><br>

                fats, eye-protecting antioxidants and brain nutrients that most people don't get enough of. Whole eggs are high in
                protein, but egg whites are almost pure protein.

                <br><br>


                <b>2. Almonds</b><br>
                Protein content: 13% of calories. 6 grams per ounce (28 g), with 161 calories.

                <b>3. Chicken Breast</b><br>
                Protein content: 80% of calories. 1 roasted chicken breast without skin contains 53 grams, with only 284 calories.
                Chicken breast is one of the most popular protein-rich foods. If you eat it without the skin, the majority of calories
                in it come from protein. Chicken breast is also very easy to cook, and tastes delicious if you do it right.

                <br><br>


                <b>4. Oats</b><br>
                Protein content: 15% of calories. Half a cup of raw oats has 13 grams, with 303 calories.
                Oats are among the healthiest grains on the planet. They are loaded with healthy fibers, magnesium, manganese, thiamin
                (vitamin B1) and several other nutrients.

                <br><br>


                <b>5. Cottage Cheese</b><br>
                Protein content: 59% of calories. A cup (226 g) of cottage cheese with 2% fat contains 27 grams of protein, with 194
                calories.
                Cottage cheese is a type of cheese that is very low in fat and calories.
                It is loaded with calcium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B12, riboflavin (vitamin B2) and various other nutrients.
                Other Types of Cheese That Are High in Protein: Parmesan cheese (38% of calories), Swiss cheese (30%), mozzarella (29%)
                and cheddar (26%).

                <br><br>


                <b>6. Greek Yogurt</b><br>
                Protein content: Non-fat Greek yogurt has protein at 48% of calories. One 6-ounce (170-gram) container has 17 grams of
                protein, with only 100 calories.
                Greek yogurt, also called strained yogurt, is a very thick type of yogurt .It tastes delicious, has a creamy texture,
                and is high in many nutrients .Choose one without added sugar. Full-fat Greek yogurt is also very high in protein, but
                contains more calories.
                Similar Options: Regular full-fat yogurt (24% of calories) and kefir (40%).

                <br><br>


                <b>7. Milk</b>
                Protein content: 21% of calories. 1 cup of whole milk contains 8 grams of protein, with 149 calories.
                Milk is highly nutritious, but the problem is that a huge percentage of the world's population is intolerant to it.
                However, if you tolerate milk and enjoy drinking it, then milk can be an excellent source of high-quality protein. Milk
                contains a little bit of almost every single nutrient needed by the human body and can provide several impressive
                health benefits. It is particularly high in calcium, phosphorus and riboflavin (vitamin B2).
